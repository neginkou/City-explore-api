**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

The City Explore API is designed to provide weather information for various cities. The goal is to create a dynamic and responsive API that allows users to retrieve weather data based on latitude, longitude, and city search queries. This project aims to enhance understanding and implementation skills in building RESTful APIs and handling data.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install the required dependencies
4. Create a .env file and set the necessary environment variables, including PORT and any API keys.
5. Start the server

## Architecture

The City Explore API is built using the following technologies:

Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
Express: Web application framework for Node.js.
dotenv: Module to load environment variables from a .env file.
Cors: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.
JSON: Data format for storing city and weather information.

The application architecture involves a RESTful API with endpoints for retrieving weather data based on user queries. Data is stored in a JSON file and dynamically processed to generate forecasts for each city.

## Change Log
